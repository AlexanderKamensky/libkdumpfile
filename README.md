============

Kernel coredump file access

To compile this package, you'll need the following:

* [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/). You can usually find it in a zlib-devel
  package.
* [lzo](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/). Often found in a
  lzo-devel package.
* [snappy](https://code.google.com/p/snappy/). Often found in a snappy-devel
   package.
* [GNU C Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html). Almost
  any version will do. Other C libraries may also work, but since there
  is no standard interface for byte-order macros, this may need some porting.
* [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/). The source uses a few construct specific
  to GCC (such as variable attributes). Porting should be easy, though.

Once you've got the prerequisites, simply unpack the tarball and run


	./configure
	make
	make install

If you updated directly from git, there is no `configure` script. That's
becuase this script itself is generated by autoconf. To bootstrap this
project from scratch, you will need:

* [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
* [automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
* [libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)

To generate the `configure` script, run

	autoreconf -fi
